## Introductionx

The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate data logging connected to the [MESC](https://github.com/davidmolony/MESC_Firmware) motor controller
The MESC firmware was developed by David Molony, and the terminal and CAN bus communications of MESC was created by [Jens Kerrinnes](https://github.com/Netzpfuscher) Special thanks to both David and Jens. 

If you're a fan of the VESC motor controller project, it is conceivable that these could be adapted to work with that system as well. 

At present the two functional programs in this repo are vert.py and headless.py
  * headless.py responds to the MQTT android app ([MQTT APP](https://github.com/owhite/MqttApp))
  * vert.py is PYQT5 app that can be run using VNC on your android

These python programs 
 * send commands over the USB-serial to the MESC controller
 * send commands or grab user parameters embedded in the controller
 * initiate streams of json data containing real time controller information
 * split out streams of data coming from the controller for logging
 * combine GPS data into the logging stream
 * create matplotlib plots of the data streams
 * handle uploads of both the data and plots to google drive
 
In general implementation of the code would occur on a raspberry PI (RPI) that is connected to the MESC controller over USB serial and physically traveling with the controller during logging. Instead of using the android as an interface it's conceivable to put a touch screen on the RPI -- I tried that and hated it. 

headless.py has undergone much more testing than vert.py

These programs are just toys and unlikely to work straight out of the box. 

## Running mosquitto

There are several tutorials for running an MQTT broker based on the mosquitto package. It works for windows, mac and linux: [LINK](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/iot-and-hardware/9781787287815/1/ch01lvl1sec12/installing-a-mosquitto-broker-on-macos), [LINK](https://cedalo.com/blog/mqtt-subscribe-publish-mosquitto-pub-sub-example/), [LINK](http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/mosquitto_pub-sub-clients/), [LINK](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/testing-mosquitto-broker-and-client-on-raspbbery-pi/). The basic idea is if you have a server (aka "broker"), running, a "publisher" can send MQTT messages, and "subscribers" to those messages will receive them. The python code example here uses the package paho.mqtt for MQTT communications. 

## Android MQTT app

This code [https://github.com/owhite/MqttApp](https://github.com/owhite/MqttApp) was generated by request through upwork.com by Atendra Singh. I recommend working with Atendra, he was a very nice person and his team was very responsive. Contact: atendra@hastree.com

To create the app, install android studio which has a very nice import function from github. Import the [MqttApp](https://github.com/owhite/MqttApp), and run compile just to see if the thing will cooperate. If it does, for [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FujlwQoKuk) to create the apk. Then search youtube for "install apk adb" to find a tutorial for installation. 

### Testing the MQTT service

Suppose you have an RPI running, it is running a mosquitto broker. You dont need to run headless to test if the android is working. To do this, first open a terminal screen on the RPI and subscribe to MQTT messages:
```
$ mosquitto_sub -u localhost -p 1883 -t "#" -u owhite -P passwd12
```

If you want to see if the broker is working, open another terminal screen and run:
```
$ mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -t "ab" -u owhite -P passwd12 -m "hello world!" 
```

and the message should get published to the broker, and appear in the other terminal that is running mosquitto_sub. 

### Testing the app

Now open up your android and set it up as a hotspot and connect the RPI to your android. The idea is the RPI has to be on the same network as the android. You'll need to dig up the IP address of the RPI once it's connected. Suppose the IP address of the RPI is *10.0.1.10*. Open the android app and go to the log screen. Youre now going to send a message to the broker, which hopefully will be received by the MqttApp. To do this, try publishing a command that creates a button on the app:
```
$ mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -t "ab" -u owhite -P passwd12 -f mqtt_commands/button_init
```

## Imports

Note that GoogleHandlerQT.py and GoogleHandler.py are basically the same except for removal of QT imports for headless.

the headless version GoogleHandler.py also does a slightly better job of making the main program independent of anything associated with the UI. (where in this case the UI is the MQTT android app). 


### note to myself

Use:
```
% autoflake --remove-all-unused-imports --in-place vert.py
```
to remove unneeded imports
